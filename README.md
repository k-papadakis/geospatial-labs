Projects for the course [Geospatial Big Data Analysis](https://github.com/rslab-ntua/MSc_GBDA) offered by the Master's program in *Data Science and Machine Learning* of the National Technical University of Athens.

The contents of the projects are summarized below:

1. Analysis on multispectral satellite images with **Google Earth Engine**.
2. Vector and raster **data exploration** using Open Geospatial Consortium protocols, geopandas and leaflet.
3. **Image segmentation** on multispectral satellite images with pixel-wise and patch-wise approaches.
4. **Video classification** with RNNs and Transformers.
5. **Object detection** on natural images with RetinaNet and Faster RCNN.
6. **Rotated object detection** on aerial images with Rotated RetinaNet and Oriented RCNN, using MMRotate.
